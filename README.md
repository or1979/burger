# Devour-da-Burger
Dream of a burger that you'd like to eat? Add it to your Eat-Da-Burger app so that you don't forget it, then mark it as "devoured" so that you can remember it forever.

Devour-da-Burger is an handlebars app where MySQL and Node.js are used to consume burgers that are stored in MySQL. The user enters a burger, which gets added to the database and if the burger is consumed, it's considered devoured. The user can continue to add new burgers, but cannot bring back devoured burgers.
